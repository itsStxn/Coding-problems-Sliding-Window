# Sliding Window

## Difficulties

### Easy

- Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock

### Medium

- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Longest Repeating Character Replacement
- Permutation In String
- Minimum Size Subarray Sum
- Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K

### Hard

- Minimum Window Substring
- Sliding Window Maximum

## Patterns

- Operates on a **contiguous subarray or substring**
- Uses **left and right pointers**
- Window **expands and shrinks**
- Asked to find **longest or shortest window**
- Asked to satisfy a **constraint or condition**
- Condition depends on **window contents**
- Requires **updating state when pointers move**
- Uses **hash map or array for counts**
- Uses **running sum or frequency tracking**
- Right pointer **adds elements**
- Left pointer **removes elements**
- Window always remains **valid or made valid**
- Avoids **nested loops**
- Ensures **O(n)** time complexity
- Used for **substring problems**
- Used for **subarray sum problems**
- Constraint is often **at most / at least**
- Used to track **unique elements**
- Used to track **frequency limits**
- Window size can be **fixed or variable**
- Fixed window slides **one step at a time**
- Variable window adjusts **based on condition**
- Requires careful **left pointer movement**
- Edge cases with **empty window**
- Works best on **arrays and strings**
- Requires thinking in terms of **range maintenance**
- Final answer updated **during traversal**
- Common mistakes involve **not shrinking window properly**
